## Projects

### 🏛️ [GovConnect - Unified Citizen Services Platform](./govconnect)

**GovConnect** is a comprehensive, citizen-facing portal designed to simplify how people interact with government services. It acts as a unified platform where citizens can discover schemes, track job opportunities, manage official documents securely, and receive AI-assisted help with grievances.

#### Key Features of GovConnect:
- **Unified Citizen Profile**: A single source of truth for personal data to drive intelligent eligibility matching.
- **Scheme Discovery Engine**: Recommends relevant government schemes with visual eligibility checklists and match percentages.
- **Government Jobs Portal**: A localized job board for discovering government vacancies, complete with deadline tracking.
- **Document Vault**: A UI for a secure document manager that simulates OCR processing states (Verified, Processing).
- **AI Grievance Assistant**: A guided workflow that analyzes user complaints, classifies the correct department, drafts formal grievances, and directs the user to the correct official portal for submission.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS v3, and React Router v6.

> **Note:** The GovConnect frontend is currently built using mock data and local state to demonstrate the UI/UX architecture. It is designed to be easily wired up to a Node.js/PostgreSQL backend in the future.
